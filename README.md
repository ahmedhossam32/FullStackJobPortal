# üíº Full Stack Job Portal App

A complete **full-stack job portal web application** built with **Java Spring Boot (Backend)** and **React + Vite (Frontend)**.  
It supports **secure authentication**, job browsing, filtering, saving, applying, and **role-based access** for job seekers and employers.  

This project is designed to provide a **real-world job marketplace experience** ‚Äî from a job seeker discovering, applying, and tracking jobs,  
to an employer posting jobs, managing applicants, and making hiring decisions.  

Every feature was **planned, built, and tested end-to-end**, covering frontend, backend, database, and API integration.

## üìñ About the Project

This application simulates the core workflows of modern job platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed but built entirely from scratch.  
It includes **secure JWT authentication**, dynamic job listing, saving and applying features, applicant management, and a fully interactive dashboard for employers.  

The project required:  
- Building a **REST API** with authentication, file upload handling, and relational data modeling in the backend.  
- Designing and implementing a **responsive React UI** from scratch without pre-made templates.  
- Managing **real-time-like updates** (e.g., notifications, application status changes).  
- Writing clean, maintainable code with modular architecture.
