### üåê Common Pages

#### 1. Home Page
![HomePage](./ScreenShots/HomePage.png)  
This is the landing page for both employers and job seekers when they access the website.  
From here, users can choose to register either as an **Employer** (to post jobs) or as a **Job Seeker** (to find jobs), depending on their needs.

---

#### 2. Selection Options
![SelectionOptions](./ScreenShots/SelectionOptions.png)
When a user clicks **Sign Up** or **Login**, a dropdown menu appears allowing them to choose their correct role ‚Äî **Job Seeker** or **Employer**.  
Selecting the right role ensures proper registration and prevents login or feature access errors.

### üë§ Job Seeker Screens

#### 1. Registering as a Job Seeker
![RegisteringJobSeeker](./ScreenShots/RegisteringJobSeeker.png)  
When registering as a job seeker, users must provide their name, username, password, date of birth, and email.  
They also have the option to upload a **profile picture** and **resume**. These two fields are optional during registration, but without a resume, users cannot apply for jobs. However, they can upload a resume later while applying.  
Uploading it now links it directly to their account for future applications.

---

#### 2. Landing Job Page
![LandingJobPage](./ScreenShots/LandingJobPage.png)  
After signing in, job seekers land on the "Jobs For You" page.  
The left side displays a list of available job cards, and the right side shows the details of the currently selected job.  
Users can filter and search for jobs by **title**, **location**, and **type** (Full-time, Part-time, Internship).

#### 3. Selected Job (Example: Google)
![SelectedJobGoogle](./ScreenShots/SelectedJobGoogle.png)

- Job type (Full-time, Part-time, Internship, etc.)  
The design ensures consistency and readability across the job listings.



#### 6. Saving a Job
![SavingGameDevJob](./ScreenShots/SavingGameDevJob.png)  
When a user saves a job (example: Game Developer at Netflix), a toast notification appears saying **"Job saved successfully!"**.

Users can save as many jobs as they want to review later.
